Varicose veins affect nearly 30% of the global population, yet most remain undiagnosed until severe complications arise. Current tools like Doppler ultrasound are accurate but costly, specialist-dependent, and hospital-bound, leaving a gap in early detection


**Problem Statement**

Varicose veins affect nearly 30% of the global population, yet most remain undiagnosed until severe complications arise.
Current tools like Doppler ultrasound are accurate but costly, specialist-dependent, and hospital-bound, leaving a gap in early detection.
There is a pressing need for an affordable, accessible solution—one that leverages cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure to enable AI-driven, user-friendly screening at scale.


**Solution**

Expected Solutions:
• An affordable, AI-powered screening system built on Microsoft Azure. Using Azure Cognitive Services and Machine Learning, we can analyze simple leg images to flag early signs, bringing preventive care to everyday users and easing pressure on healthcare systems.
